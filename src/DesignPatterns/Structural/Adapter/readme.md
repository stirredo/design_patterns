### Adapter interface

The adapter pattern converts the interface of a class into another interface the clients expect. Adapter lets classes
work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

Real world example: In Java we might write an EnumeratorInterface to adapt to Iterator so that we can pass it as an
iterator.
