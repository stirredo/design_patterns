### Flyweight Pattern

To minimise memory usage, a Flyweight shares as much as possible memory with similar objects. It is needed when a large amount of objects is used that don't differ much in state. A common practice is to hold state in external data structures and pass them to the flyweight object when needed.

Use the Flyweight Pattern when one instance of a class can be used to provide many virtual instances.
