### Composite Pattern

` The Composite Pattern allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.`

`Let’s think about this in terms of our menus: this pattern gives us a way to create a tree structure that can handle a nested group of menus and menu items in the same structure. By putting menus and items in the same structure we create a part-whole hierarchy—that is, a tree of objects that is made of parts (menus and menu items) but that can be treated as a whole, like one big über menu.`
