### Strategy Pattern

From GoF:

`Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.`

Strategy patterns let change algorithms to change behaviour of an object on the fly.

In my example, the fly behaviour and quack behaviour are algorithms that may change. We use the algorithm according to
the client (various ducks).
