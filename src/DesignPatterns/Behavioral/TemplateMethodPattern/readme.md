### Template Method Pattern

Template Method Pattern defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. Template
method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.

### Difference between Template Method Pattern and Strategy Pattern

Template method pattern defines the outline of the algorithm and lets the subclasses define the configurable behaviour.
Strategy pattern allows changing behaviour through composition and not inheritance. The behaviour in strategy pattern
may be swapped at runtime.
