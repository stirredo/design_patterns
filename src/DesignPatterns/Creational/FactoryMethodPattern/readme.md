### Factory Method Pattern

Factory method pattern defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to
instantiate. Factory method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

A factory method handles object creation and encapsulates it in a subclass. This decouples the client code in the
superclass from the object creation code in the subclass.
